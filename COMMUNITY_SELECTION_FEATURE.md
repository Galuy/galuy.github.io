# Community Selection Feature Implementation

## Summary

Added community selection functionality to the Dashboard note creation form, allowing users to choose which community to share their notes in.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced NewNoteForm Component (`src/components/NewNoteForm.jsx`)

- Added `communities` prop to receive list of user's communities
- Added `showCommunitySelector` prop to control visibility of community selector
- Added `selectedCommunityId` state to track selected community
- Added community selection dropdown UI
- Updated `onSubmit` to pass both fields and selectedCommunityId
- **Updated default fields from "Title, URL" to "Title, Description" for better note creation UX**

### 2. Updated Dashboard Component (`src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`)

- Added `userCommunities` state to store user's communities
- Added useEffect to fetch user's communities in real-time
- Modified `handleAddNote` to create either personal or shared notes based on community selection
- Updated NewNoteForm usage to pass communities and enable community selector

### 3. Updated Community Component (`src/pages/Community.jsx`)

- Modified `handleAddSharedNote` function signature to maintain compatibility with NewNoteForm changes

### 4. Enhanced Styling (`src/components/NewNoteForm.module.css`)

- Added styles for `.communitySelector`, `.label`, and `.select`
- Maintains consistent design with existing form elements

## Functionality

### User Experience

1. When creating a new note from Dashboard, users see a dropdown to select a community
2. Default option is "üìù Nota Personale" (personal note)
3. User communities are listed as "üë• Community Name"
4. If no community is selected, note is created as personal note
5. If community is selected, note is created as shared note in that community

### Technical Implementation

- Personal notes are saved to `notes` collection with `uid` field
- Shared notes are saved to `sharedNotes` collection with `communityId` and `authorId` fields
- Real-time updates ensure communities list stays current
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing note creation flows

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] User can create personal notes (default behavior)
- [ ] User can select a community and create shared notes
- [ ] Community dropdown only shows communities the user is a member of
- [ ] Real-time updates work for both personal and shared notes
- [ ] Existing community note creation still works
- [ ] CSS styling is consistent and responsive

## Database Impact

- No schema changes required
- Uses existing `communities` collection structure
- Uses existing `notes` and `sharedNotes` collections
- Maintains all existing functionality
